# MCM_Code
Multicolored Matrix (MCM) Code is a two dimensional matrix type symbol, consisting of colored squares, that is arranged as an image sequence rendered at an optimum frame rate to transfer simple data between devices using sender’s screen display and receiver’s camera. MCM code introduces an untried channel-less short range communication technology, designed with limitless storage capacity, great structural stability and flexibility due to which it can work in harsh lighting environments and still combat readability issues in the decoding process. The idea, inspired by the existing QR code, has various code types in terms of number of colors and size of matrix depending on length of the data, in the code generation and encoding process. This paper introduces our new idea of data transfer, the technical features of the code along with the encoding-decoding techniques, bit error rates and future scope of improvements for the idea.
